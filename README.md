BI1 revision 4 (myf14)

The “body interactor”(BI) is a printed circuit board (PCB) with a vibrator motor, an accelerometer, a LiPo battery and battery charger and wireless radio frequency (RF) communication. The board can be programmed with the Arduino software.

The BI is designed for building a wearable autonomous device: With the accelerometer, movement data can be recorded and send to other BI by wireless RF communication. Gestures can be recognised and used for controlling the vibrator motor as well as other devices and applications using wireless communication (e.g. other BIs, computer games).

Different vibration pattern can be used to give the wearer information or feedback. Other use cases for vibration are massage application or moving objects (e.g. “vibrobot”).

The development board is particular suitable for people who are interested in application development using this kind of hardware arrangement and to construct an individual printed encasement for the board. Board, 3D printed encasement and Arduino program together are the individual final product. In addition the wireless communication function offers applications comprising multiple BI in different cases and with different tasks. In contrast changes, adaption or extensions (shields) of the board are rather complex.
